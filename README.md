# AMULET-AudioSpoof

More detailed information on the implementation of **Adaptive Mixture of Low-Rank Experts for Robust Audio Spoofing Detection** is available here.

Additional implementation details are provided in the [`experimental_setup.xlsx`](./experimental_setup.xlsx) file, which contains process for model training, as well as the parameters and methods used for data preprocessing throughout the experiments. Under `data_generate_code` folder is the data processing code for this work.

**We will release our model code and pretrained weights upon the acceptance of our work.**
